# 💰 TipCalculator App

## Project Overview
The **TipCalculator App** is a simple JavaFX application that helps users calculate the tip amount based on their bill and preferred tip percentage. Users can enter the bill amount, adjust the tip percentage using a slider, and instantly see the calculated tip and total amount due.

This project is part of 📘 *CSC 325 - Software Engineering* Lab 5, with a focus on building JavaFX applications and handling events and property bindings.

## Features
- 🎚️ **Tip Percentage Slider**: Adjust the tip percentage dynamically to see real-time changes in the tip and total amounts.
- 💵 **Bill Amount Input**: Enter the bill amount, and the app will calculate the tip and total based on the entered value and selected percentage.
- 📊 **Instant Calculations**: The app updates the tip and total immediately when users adjust the slider or modify the bill amount.

## Technologies Used
- ☕ **JavaFX**: For GUI development and managing user interactions.
- 📄 **FXML**: Defines the layout and components of the GUI.
- 💻 **Java**: Implements the core application logic and calculations.

## How to Run
1. Ensure JavaFX is installed and properly configured in your Java IDE.
2. Open the project in an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
3. Run the `TipCalculator` class to start the application.

## Project Structure
- `TipCalculator.java`: Main application class that initializes and displays the JavaFX window.
- `TipCalculatorController.java`: Controller class handling user input, calculations, and updates to the GUI.
- `TipCalculator.fxml`: FXML layout file defining the GUI components, such as input fields and the tip percentage slider.
